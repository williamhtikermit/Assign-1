  <h1> My Profile </h1>
  <h2><u> Personal Information </u></h2>
  <img src="Me.jpg" width="240" height="240" style="float: right">
  <p>I am Wai Yan Htike, but many know me as William. I am an international student and I lived in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Since I am from Myanmar, my first language is Burmese. I have been speaking and learning English as long as I can remember and I am fluent in it. As of right now, I only speak two languages, but I am trying to learn Spanish. I have done IGCESE O Level and finished RMIT Foundation in 2019. I attended my first year in RMIT University last year but COVID came in and I had to take leave. Now, I am back at my study in RMIT University. I have a strong hobby in photography, but I cannot afford expensive cameras. So, I use my phone and posted photos on my Instagram.</p>
  <h2><u> Interest In IT </u></h2>
  <p>Ever since I was a kid, I am always into electronics. I love to open electronics despite of warranty issues and explore the inside parts. As I get older, my interest shifts to software, especially Operating System. I love to install unstable beta version of OS on both old iPhones and Android’s.  I love finding bugs in beta version and report back. Although bugs seem to annoy many users, they don’t have that kind of effect on me. I come to RMIT to finish my degrees because I believe that RMIT is one of the most practical universities in the country. After my degrees, I hope I become a good developer and use my degree to help other people.</p>
  <h2><u>Ideal Job</u></h2>
  <img src="The Job.jpg" width="350" height="330" style="float: right">
  <p>As for my ideal job, I would like to become an app developer, either freelance or working full-time job. Before becoming professional software developer, I think going for a junior position in a company could be my first step to achieve what I would like to do. I found out that this Junior Software Developer looks very appealing to me since the job can train to become professionally. Moreover, this job is looking for someone who have experiences in programming such as C# and Python. Since I am studying Python in university and had learnt C Programming previously, this job stands out and appeal to me the most. SQL is not essential but desirable skill for this job, and it makes the job more appealing. I am working on many of the skills essential for the job but I still have to work on teamworking skills since I am going to work in teams in many professional scenarios and I am not particularly excell at teamworking.</p>
  <p>The link to my ideal job is <a href = "https://www.totaljobs.com/job/junior-software-developer/sparta-global-job92194206?src=search&page=1&position=3&WT.mc_id=A_PT_CrossBrand_Jobsite&searchCriteria=IT&searchLocation=&source=jobsite"> HERE</a>.</p>
  <h2><u>Personal Profile</u></h2>
  <p>To find out about my personalities and traits in details, I did 3 tests to find out online. They are Myers-Brigg Test (MBT), learning style test and Emotional Intelligence Test. As for Myers-Brigg Test, I found out that I am Turbulent Virtuoso (ISTP-T). It basically means people with this personality tends to explore new stuff via their eyes, hands, touching and examining with high level of curiosity although they can be introverted. Additionally, Virtuoso in general loves to explore ideas with creating, troubleshooting trails and errors. As for my online learning style, I thought I would be a visual learner but turned out I am auditory learner, meaning I learn things via listening and hearing. I remember things by heard or remember the way things sound. Moreover, I can follow instructions if given by spoken means instead of written. When I did my Emotional Intelligence Test, I barely pass the test since I find it difficult to read people’s facial expression to know what they are actually feeling. But I find rooms for improvements.</p>
  <h2><u>Project Idea </u></h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>	My project idea is to make primarily an end-to-end encryption messaging app that is available both online and offline but specifically targeted toward the people of Myanmar. I want this app to available on phones, laptops or tablets. But I want target smartphones first since every people in the country has one in their hands. Then I hope I can move on the rest devices.</p>
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>	Recent events in my country, Myanmar led to have a spark in this idea. Since February, there is a coup and many internet services, including Wi-Fi, fibers or mobile data have been shut down. So not many people have access to news online or able to communicate other safely online. Therefore, I want to make a messaging app offline that can be communicated via Bluetooth and network for particular area. Additionally, citizens have no guarantee whether government can tap into their phone calls and SMS messages. </p>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p><	Although my project idea is primarily a messaging app, it will have wide range of features. Mainly, the app will be divided into online and offline. Since this app will be mainly targeted toward the people of Myanmar, the language setting will be in Burmese default. This is the best option since Burmese is the primary language in the country. However, users will be able to change to English if they ever wanted. Many more languages are going to be added in future updates. As for the offline aspect, users will be able to use Bluetooth or Mesh network created by the devices or sign in same network without needing Internet connection. When users open the app with Bluetooth it will create a Mesh network. For the online communication features, users must setup their account with their mobile numbers. Users will be allowed to sync with the contacts on their devices if the permission from the users is ever granted. If not, users are able to make and add separated contacts on this app. All the chats, phone call and video calls are end-to-end encrypted making a safe place for users to communicate. Group chats and group calls are also available in the app. With the permission of users, they can choose to import all the photos and videos or selected ones of their choice and will be able to share with other users. With users’ permission, they can set any timer for the messages or shared photos and videos to disappear. Finally, users will be also to sync their call history or messages with other devices, such as tablet or laptops. </p>
  <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
  <p>	As for the tools and technology, API and Software Development Kits are essential. Several teams will be needed which each specific role. For instance, while one of the team is working on coding another will be working on UI/UX. There will also be beta testers to fix bugs and crashes.</p>
  <h3>Required Skills</h3>
  <p>	To make this app into reality, experienced programming skills are needed. Developers need to know more than a programming language. Depending on the platform the app is going to be released, language going to be used will be different. For instance, java or python will be mainly used for android or window application whereas Swift will be used for iOS and MacOS application. </p>
  <h3>Outcome</h3>
  <p>	When this app is at the hand of people, it would be huge improvements and contribution to the people of third world country like Myanmar. This app will be essential and must have app on everyone’s devices since it will be a safe place for people to communicate with tones of features packed in one. </p>
